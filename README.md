Yan Bo's Coding Samples

"Python Coding Sample" is a final project report for an undergraduate data science course. It shows my familiarity in Python for
data analysis and statistical learning. I would like to thank Annie Lee and Mellissa Perez for their contributions in the
background research and final presentation.

"R_tic_tac_toe": Type play() on the console to start a tic tac toe game. Please first execute the entire script.
