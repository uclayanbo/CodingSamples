Yan Bo's Coding Samples

"Python Coding Sample" is a final project report for an undergraduate data science course. It shows my familiarity in Python for data analysis and statistical learning. I would like to thank Annie Lee and Mellissa Perez for their contributions in the background research and final presentation.

“Bayesian Interpretation of Ratings” is an RA task for Professor Ashvin Gandhi’s (UCLA Anderson) project on star ratings for General Practitioners (GPs) in the UK. It models how a Bayesian consumer should interpret the expected quality of a GP given that the UK quality ratings website only shows the average star rating (rounded to the nearest half-star) and the number of ratings the GP has received. One assumption is that consumers should place more weight on average ratings for GPs that have received a large sample of ratings in the past.

“Local_Projection” explores the response of some core macroeconomic variables to changes in total factor productivity (TFP), following Valerie Ramey (2016). Specifically, I use a local projection approach (Jorda, 2005) to compute the response of these variables at various horizons to two different measures of TFP shock. The program is intended to be reused for different applications, so it is split into subroutines. Flexible programming is emphasized, and hard-coding values are avoided.

"R_tic_tac_toe": Type play() on the console to start a tic tac toe game. Please first execute the entire script.
